## Development Environment Setup

### Dependencies

#### Node
You will first need the right node version installed. The easiest
way to manage node is with [nvm](https://www.nvmnode.com/). You will 
then need to enable corepack.
```shell
corepack enable
```

#### Docker
We will use [docker](https://www.docker.com/) for build. 

#### Docker Compose
You will use [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install) compose 
for running our local environment services.

### Install Application
We will use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) for package management.

```shell
pnpm install
```

### Start Local Services
